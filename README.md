# My Data Analytics Project

This is my first Data Analytics project using pandas and matplotlib.  
This project is based on Sales Analysis over a year.  
This project mainly answers 4 questions:
- Maximum sale in which month?
- Maximum sale by which city?
- Most suitable time for sale?
- And which products are sold together?

I have used various Python functions such as `split` and `join` for ease in data analysis.
